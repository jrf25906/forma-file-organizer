## One-Liner

Forma is a macOS file organizer that proposes changes, waits for your approval, and lets you undo everything.

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Forma brings order to your digital workspace without acting on its own. Unlike AI organizers that make decisions for you, Forma shows you every proposed change before it happens. Create rules in plain language, preview the results, then approve or reject. Every action is recorded and reversible with one click. Files never leave your Mac—all processing happens locally.

## Full Description (Press Release Format)

### Forma Launches: The File Organizer That Respects Your Decisions

**[City, Date]** — Forma, a new macOS utility, offers a fresh approach to file organization: propose first, act second.

While automation tools like Hazel require scripting expertise and AI organizers like Sparkle act autonomously, Forma occupies the middle ground. Users create declarative rules through a visual interface—"Move screenshots older than 7 days to Archive"—and Forma proposes destinations for matching files. Nothing moves until the user approves.

"People treat their file system like a bank vault," says [Founder Name]. "They need an organizer they can trust. Forma earns that trust by showing exactly what it plans to do, waiting for approval, and making every action reversible."

**Key Features:**
- **Preview Queue**: See every proposed change before execution
- **Full Undo History**: Complete action log with one-click rollback
- **Declarative Rules**: Natural-language rule creation without scripting
- **100% Local**: On-device processing; files never leave your Mac
- **Native macOS**: Built with native APIs, not Electron

Forma is available now on the Mac App Store. Free to download and try, with unlimited features available via subscription ($4.99/month or $49.99/year).
