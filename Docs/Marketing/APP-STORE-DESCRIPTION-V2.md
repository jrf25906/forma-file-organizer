## Description (Revised)

**See before you move. Undo anything. Stay in control.**

Forma organizes your files without acting on its own. It proposes. You approve. Every action is reversible.

**PREVIEW FIRST**
Other tools move files immediately or let AI decide for you. Forma shows you every proposed change before it happens. Approve one file or a hundred—nothing moves until you say so.

**UNDO EVERYTHING**
Made a mistake? Changed your mind? Every action Forma takes is recorded. Roll back any change with one click. Experiment freely.

**CREATE RULES, NOT SCRIPTS**
Define organization logic in plain language:
- "Move screenshots older than 7 days to Archive"
- "Put invoices in Finance/2025"
- "Archive project files after 6 months"

No scripting. No regex. Just rules that read like sentences.

**PATTERN MATCHING**
Forma infers structure from file names, dates, types, and sizes. When it suggests a destination, you can see exactly why. Transparent, not magical.

**NATIVE AND PRIVATE**
Built exclusively for macOS with native file APIs. All processing happens on your Mac. Your files—and their names—never leave the device.

**FEATURES**
- Preview Queue: See all proposed moves before execution
- Action History: Full log with instant rollback
- 30+ Templates: Ready-made rules for common files
- Background Monitor: (Coming Soon) Keep folders tidy automatically
- Natural Language Rules: Describe intent, not syntax

**WHAT USERS SAY**
"Finally, a file organizer that shows me what it's going to do before it does it."

"Hazel is too complex for me. Forma just works."

## Alternative Descriptions (A/B Testing Candidates)

### Variant A: Trust-Focused
**Trust your file organizer again.**

Forma proposes changes. You approve them. Nothing moves without your permission. Everything can be undone.

Unlike AI organizers that act on their own, Forma respects your decisions. See every proposed file move before it happens. Reject what doesn't look right. Undo anything that goes wrong.

[Rest of features as above]

### Variant B: Problem-Focused
**Your Downloads folder has 847 files. Let's fix that.**

Forma turns folder chaos into organized structure—but only after you approve. No surprises. No autonomous AI. Just clear proposals you can accept, reject, or undo.

[Rest of features as above]

### Variant C: Comparison-Focused
**More approachable than Hazel. More transparent than AI organizers.**

Forma is the file organizer for people who want automation without losing control. Define rules visually. Preview every change. Undo anything.

## Notes for Iteration

**Strongest hooks** (based on positioning):
1. "See before you move" — unique differentiator
2. "Undo anything" — reduces anxiety
3. "No scripting" — accessibility vs. Hazel

**Consider testing**:
- Lead with problem ("847 files") vs. solution ("Give your files form")
- Emoji usage in features section (currently none per brand guidelines)
- Competitor comparison in promotional text

**Localization ready**: Avoid idioms; description uses clear, translatable language.
