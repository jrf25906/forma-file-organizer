### Long Version (Blog Post, Product Hunt)
**Introducing Forma: File Organization Without Surprises**

Your Downloads folder is a mess. Your Desktop is worse. You've tried organizing manually—it never sticks. You've looked at automation tools—Hazel is intimidating, and AI organizers move files without asking.

Forma takes a different approach: **propose first, act second.**

Define rules in plain language: "Move screenshots older than 7 days to Archive." Forma finds matching files and shows you exactly where it plans to put them. You review. You approve. Then—and only then—files move.

Changed your mind? Every action is recorded. Undo anything with one click.

**Why Forma?**
- **Preview everything**: See proposed moves before execution
- **Undo anything**: Full action history with instant rollback
- **Stay in control**: Nothing moves without your approval
- **Complete privacy**: 100% local processing on your Mac

Forma is free to try. Unlimited features with a subscription: $4.99/month or $49.99/year.

### LinkedIn Announcement

**Launching Forma: A Different Approach to File Organization**

After months of development, I'm excited to share Forma—a macOS file organizer built on a simple principle: **show before you move**.

Most automation tools fall into two camps:
1. **Complex and powerful** (Hazel) — great for power users, intimidating for everyone else
2. **AI-powered and autonomous** (Sparkle, Sorted) — convenient but opaque

Forma occupies the middle ground. Create rules in plain language. Preview every proposed change. Approve what looks right. Undo anything.

Key features:
- Preview Queue: See all proposed moves before execution
- Full Undo History: Rollback any action, anytime
- 100% Local: Files never leave your Mac
- Native macOS: Built with Swift, not Electron

If you've ever wished file organization was less risky to experiment with, I'd love for you to try Forma.

Available now on the Mac App Store. Free to download.

### Hacker News Launch

**Show HN: Forma – File organizer with preview-first workflow**

I built Forma because I wanted Hazel's power without the scripting, and AI organizers' convenience without losing control.

Forma sits in between:
- Create rules visually: "Move screenshots older than 7 days to Archive"
- See every proposed move before it happens
- Approve individually or in batches
- Undo any action with one click
- 100% local—files never leave your Mac

Technical details:
- Swift + SwiftUI
- Native macOS file APIs
- No Electron, no web views
- Universal binary (Apple Silicon + Intel)

Looking for feedback on the preview-first workflow. Does showing proposed changes before execution increase trust, or does it add friction?

Free tier available. Subscription for unlimited rules.

### Product Hunt Tagline & Description

**Tagline**: The file organizer that asks before it acts

**Description**:
Forma organizes your files without acting on its own. Create rules in plain language, preview every proposed move, then approve or reject. Every action is reversible.

Unlike AI organizers that decide for you, Forma shows the plan and waits. Unlike traditional automation, Forma doesn't require scripting.

Preview first. Undo always. Stay in control.

**Maker Comment**:
I built Forma because I was frustrated with the extremes: Hazel requires me to think like a programmer, and AI tools move files without asking.

Forma is the middle path. Visual rules. Transparent suggestions. Full reversibility.

Would love your feedback on the preview workflow—is it the right balance of control and convenience?
