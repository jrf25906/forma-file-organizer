## Positioning Summary

### The Goldilocks Zone

| Approach | Limitation | Forma's Position |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Manual folders** | Constant maintenance | Rules automate the work |
| **Hazel / Scripts** | Intimidating, no preview | Visual interface, preview-first |
| **AI auto-organizers** | Act without approval | Nothing moves until you approve |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Preview-First Execution**: See every proposed change before it happens
2. **Full Reversibility**: Complete action history with one-click undo
3. **100% Local Processing**: Files and filenames never leave your Mac
4. **Native macOS Design**: Built with native APIs, not Electron
5. **Low Learning Curve**: Visual interface, not rule scripting
