# Forma Feature Highlights

**Purpose**: Marketing-ready feature descriptions for press, social, and website
**Format**: Each feature includes a headline, hook, description, and proof points

---

## 1. Preview Queue

### Headline
**See every move before it happens.**

### Hook
Other file organizers act first, apologize later. Forma shows you the plan.

### Description
The Preview Queue displays every proposed file move in a clear list. See the source file, the destination folder, and why Forma suggests it. Approve one file, a batch, or everything at once. Reject what doesn't look right. Nothing moves until you decide.

### Proof Points
- View source and destination side-by-side
- See the rule that triggered each suggestion
- Approve individually or in bulk
- Filter by file type, date, or confidence

### Social Copy (280 chars)
> "Move these 47 files?" Other organizers just do it. Forma shows you exactly where each file will go—and waits for your approval. Preview first. Act second.

---

## 2. Full Undo History

### Headline
**Undo anything. Always.**

### Hook
Made a mistake? Changed your mind? Forma remembers everything.

### Description
Every action Forma takes is logged in a complete history. Undo a single move from yesterday. Roll back a batch from last week. The history persists across sessions, so you can always go back. File organization becomes low-stakes experimentation.

### Proof Points
- Complete action log with timestamps
- One-click undo for any action
- Batch rollback for multiple changes
- Persistent history across sessions

### Social Copy (280 chars)
> "I can't undo that!" — every file organizer except Forma. Full action history. One-click rollback. Experiment freely.

## 3. Declarative Rules

### Headline
**Rules that read like sentences.**

### Hook
No scripting. No regex. Just plain language.

### Description
Create organization rules the way you think about them: "Move screenshots older than 7 days to Archive." "Put invoices in Finance/2025." Forma translates your intent into action. Change rules anytime—Forma adapts.

### Proof Points
- Natural language syntax
- Visual rule builder interface
- 30+ ready-made templates
- Edit or disable rules anytime

### Social Copy (280 chars)
> "Move screenshots older than 7 days to Archive." That's a Forma rule. No regex. No scripting. Just intent.

## 4. Pattern Matching

### Headline
**Transparent, not magical.**

### Hook
Forma shows you why—not just what.

### Description
Forma infers structure from file names, extensions, dates, and sizes. When it suggests a destination, you see the reasoning: "This looks like a screenshot from January based on filename pattern and date." Correct a suggestion once, and Forma adapts future behavior.

### Proof Points
- Visible reasoning for every suggestion
- Learns from your corrections
- Pattern recognition without AI cloud calls
- Configurable confidence thresholds

> Why did Forma suggest that folder? Click to find out. Pattern matching you can inspect, correct, and trust.

## 5. 100% Local Processing

### Headline
**Your files never leave your Mac.**

### Hook
Complete privacy. No cloud. No exceptions.

### Description
Forma processes everything on-device using native macOS APIs. Your files stay on your computer. Their names stay on your computer. No telemetry, no cloud sync, no third-party services. Just your Mac doing the work.

### Proof Points
- Native macOS file APIs
- No network calls for file analysis
- No cloud sync or storage
- Works completely offline

### Social Copy (280 chars)
> AI file organizers send your filenames to the cloud. Forma doesn't send anything. 100% local. Complete privacy.

## 6. Native macOS Design

### Headline
**Built for Mac. Only for Mac.**

### Hook
No Electron. No cross-platform compromises.

### Description
Forma is built exclusively for macOS using Swift and native frameworks. It looks like a Mac app, feels like a Mac app, and performs like a Mac app. Launches instantly. Uses minimal resources. Integrates with Finder, Spotlight, and system shortcuts.

### Proof Points

## 7. Ready-Made Templates

### Headline
**Start organizing in 60 seconds.**

### Hook
30+ rules for common files. Zero configuration.

### Proof Points
- Screenshot organization by date
