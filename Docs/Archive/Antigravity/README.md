# Antigravity Development Documentation - Archive

**Archived:** January 18, 2025
**Reason:** Project development shifted away from Antigravity/Gemini 3 Pro tooling

---

## What's Archived Here

This directory contains documentation created for developing Forma using Google's Antigravity IDE with Gemini 3 Pro. While these techniques were valuable during initial prototyping, the project has evolved to use standard development workflows.

### Files

1. **ANTIGRAVITY_PROMPT.md** (342 lines)
   - Complete development prompt for Gemini 3 Pro
   - Design system specifications
   - Brand attributes and visual language
   - UI-first development approach
   - Reference to design inspiration images

2. **USING_ANTIGRAVITY.md** (323 lines)
   - Step-by-step guide for using the prompt
   - Iteration strategies
   - Temperature settings and best practices
   - Brand drift detection
   - Troubleshooting tips

3. **PROMPTING_TECHNIQUES.md** (488 lines)
   - Advanced prompting strategies for Gemini 3 Pro
   - Structured delimiter patterns
   - Multimodal reference techniques
   - Iteration workflows
   - Feedback optimization methods

**Total archived:** 1,153 lines

## Why Archive?

These documents were specific to:
- Google's Antigravity IDE (experimental tool)
- Gemini 3 Pro model-specific prompting
- UI prototyping workflow that has been completed

The project now focuses on:
- Direct SwiftUI development in Xcode
- Standard macOS development practices
- Feature implementation and refinement

---

## What to Reference Instead

**For current development:**
- `Docs/Getting-Started/SETUP.md` - Installation and setup
- `Docs/Design/Forma-Design-Doc.md` - Product vision and features
- `Docs/Design/Forma-Brand-Guidelines.md` - Brand system (still relevant)
- `TODO.md` - Current priorities

**For UI design reference:**
- The brand guidelines still contain the core design system
- Design inspiration images (if preserved)
- Forma-Brand-Guidelines.md has the complete visual language

---

## Historical Context

These files represent an early phase of Forma development where:
1. UI/UX design was the primary focus
2. Antigravity was used for rapid prototyping
3. Gemini 3 Pro generated initial SwiftUI scaffolding
4. Visual language was being established

The brand attributes defined here (Precise, Refined, Confident) **remain core to Forma** and are documented in the main brand guidelines.

## Should You Read These?

**Yes, if:**
- You're interested in the project's design evolution
- You want to understand advanced AI-assisted development techniques
- You're exploring Gemini 3 Pro prompting strategies
- You want context on how the visual language was created

**No, if:**
- You're setting up the project for the first time
- You're implementing new features
- You're fixing bugs or troubleshooting
- You need current development documentation

**Note:** While archived, these techniques may be valuable for future UI/design work or other projects using similar AI-assisted development workflows.

**For questions about current Forma development, see the main documentation in `Docs/` and the repo entry points in the root directory.**
