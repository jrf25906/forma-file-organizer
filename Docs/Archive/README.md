# Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived documentation that has been superseded or is no longer actively maintained.

**Status:** Archived (historical)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-06

## Archive Notes

- Some files include machine-specific paths (e.g., `/Users/username/...`) and one-off debug output.
- Archived docs should still be safe to share; prefer redacting real usernames/emails if you copy/paste logs.
- Doc conventions and placeholders: [Docs/DOCUMENTATION_STYLE.md](../DOCUMENTATION_STYLE.md).
