## Documentation Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth** - Each topic has one authoritative document
2. **Categorized by Purpose** - Docs organized by how they're used
3. **Clear Entry Points** - README files guide you to the right docs
4. **Archive, Don't Delete** - Historical docs preserved for reference
