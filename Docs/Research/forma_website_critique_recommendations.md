# Forma Website — Critique & Recommendations (Edited)

This document consolidates feedback on **formafiles.com** into actionable recommendations, prioritized by impact.

---

## 1. Core Diagnosis

**The site is credible but not inevitable.**

It explains what Forma does, but does not fully prove:
- Why Forma's approach is uniquely *safe*
- Why it outperforms existing workflows without introducing anxiety

Forma should feel like the first file organizer that is powerful *because* it is constrained.

---

## 2. The Central Reframe: From "Smart" to "Structural"

This is the most important strategic shift.

Forma is currently framed as *intelligent*. It should be framed as *structural*.

Users don't ask: "Is this smart?"
They ask: "Where does this sit in my system?"

Until that question is answered explicitly, trust will stall.

**Forma should present itself as:**
- A **system layer**, not a replacement for Finder
- An **executor of intent**, not an autonomous actor
- A **bounded tool**, not a magical one

**The site must explicitly answer: Is Forma a layer or a replacement?**

Answer clearly:
- Forma is a layer on top of Finder
- Files remain on disk, untouched, until approved actions occur
- Forma maintains a private, on-device index used only to *propose* changes

This should be communicated visually, not defensively.

---

## 3. The Trust Gap

Users treat their file system like a bank vault.

Current messaging implies:
- Opaque intelligence
- Implicit autonomy
- AI-driven reorganization

Even when safety features exist, *implied autonomy* creates fear.

**Winning posture:**
> You give the orders. Forma executes them — and only after you approve.

Trust is inherited through structure, not earned through reassurance.

---

## 4. Kill the "Ghost of AI"

Phrases like "Talk to it like a human" signal:
- Latency
- Chat interfaces
- Vague probabilistic behavior

This is hostile to users who want control.

**Consider replacement language:**
- Semantic shortcuts
- Intent-based commands
- Declarative file rules

Forma is not something you *chat with*. It is something you *direct*.

---

## 5. Visual Weight & Hierarchy

The current layout treats all sections as visual peers. For a file system tool, this is a mistake.

**Safety is not a feature. It is the foundation.** The visual system must reflect that.

### Needs More Visual Weight

1. **Undo Everything**
   - Should be one of the heaviest sections on the page
   - Larger type, more vertical space, distinct background
   - It should *interrupt* the scroll

2. **Preview Queue / Approval State**
   - Should feel like a primary UI surface, not a supporting screenshot
   - Treat it like a control panel, not a feature callout
   - This is where trust is earned visually

3. **Architecture Diagram (Layer vs Replacement)**
   - Deserves more prominence than persona copy
   - Clear spatial hierarchy: Finder → Files → Forma Layer → Proposed Actions

### Needs Less Visual Weight

- Taglines and aspirational copy
- Repeated benefit cards
- Vanity stats

High-taste sites use *uneven rhythm* deliberately: dense sections where attention is required (safety, architecture), spacious sections where confidence is implied.

---

## 6. Show the Ugly Reality

Perfect files imply shallow value.

Forma should be shown handling:
- Messy filenames
- Redundant versions
- Chaotic exports

Example:
> `Final_v2_edit_FINAL_FOR-REAL.mov → ClientName_Deliverable_2024-03.mov`

This is proof of necessity.

---

## 7. Concrete Recommendations

### A. Narrative Order (Trust Before Magic)

Reorder sections:
1. You approve. It executes.
2. Undo everything. Always.
3. Natural language rules
4. Context awareness

Lead with control, follow with capability.

### B. Make "Context" Legible

Under context/intelligence sections, add concrete explanation:

> Forma infers structure using time, filenames, originating apps, and folder history. You can rename or correct a project once — Forma adapts future suggestions automatically.

Avoid language that implies opaque AI autonomy.

### C. Comparison Block

Add a short, neutral comparison:

| Approach | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| **Folders** | Manual, brittle, require constant maintenance |
| **Tags** | Powerful, but depend on perfect human discipline |
| **Automation tools** | Flexible, but fragile and intimidating |
| **Forma** | Declarative rules, preview-first execution, full reversibility |

No snark. Just clarity.

### D. Replace Vanity Stats With Capability Proof

Remove unverifiable absolutes like "Zero files lost. Ever."

Replace with:
- Works with Desktop, Downloads, and Documents (you choose)
- Preview every change before it happens
- Full action history with one-click rollback

### E. Value Pillars With Specifics

Be concrete:
- **Mac-native** — Uses native file APIs. No Electron.
- **Private** — On-device processing. Files never leave your Mac.
- **Fast** — Launches and previews in milliseconds on Apple Silicon.

Specificity builds trust. Slogans don't.

### F. CTA Consistency

Use consistent CTAs throughout:
- **Primary**: Join the beta
- **Secondary**: Watch a 30-second demo

Repeat in hero, mid-page, and footer.

---

## 8. Persona Guidance

Avoid job titles. Target behavior.

**Instead of:**
> Built for creative professionals who refuse chaos.

**Use:**
> Built for people whose files outgrow folders — where screenshots, documents, assets, and ideas pile up faster than folders can handle.

The unifying thread is not profession, but *care*: people who take their work seriously and expect their tools to do the same.

---

## 9. Constrained Automation Philosophy

Forma should explicitly embrace limits. Consider surfacing these principles:

- Automation must be reversible
- Intelligence must be inspectable
- Files remain yours

Boundaries increase trust.

---

## 10. Canonical Narrative (Summary)

Forma is a system layer for macOS files.

It builds a private, on-device index and lets you issue declarative commands.
Nothing moves without preview.
Everything can be undone.

Forma does not organize your life.
**It executes your intent — safely.**
