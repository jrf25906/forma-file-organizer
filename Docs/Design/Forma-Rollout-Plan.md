# Forma Rollout Strategy: Beta to v1.0

A phased approach to launching Forma, ensuring stability and building hype.

## 🗓 Phase 1: Alpha (Internal)
**Timeline**: Weeks 1-2
**Audience**: You + 3 close friends (Designers/Devs)
**Goal**: Verify core loop (Scan -> Organize -> Move) without data loss.

*   **Focus**:
    *   Safety checks (Does it ever delete the wrong thing?)
    *   Performance on large desktops (10k+ files)
    *   Basic rule engine logic
*   **Success Metric**: 0 critical bugs, 0 data loss incidents.

## 🧪 Phase 2: Closed Beta (The "Clean 50")
**Timeline**: Weeks 3-6
**Audience**: 50 hand-picked users from Twitter/Design communities.
**Distribution**: TestFlight (macOS)

*   **Focus**:
    *   Edge case discovery (Network drives, weird permissions)
    *   Rule library expansion (What rules do they create?)
    *   UX friction points (Where do they get stuck?)
*   **Action**: Create a Discord for feedback.
*   **Success Metric**: 80% of users organize at least 100 files.

## 📢 Phase 3: Open Beta (Public)
**Timeline**: Weeks 7-10
**Audience**: 500+ users via Product Hunt "Ship" / Waitlist.
**Distribution**: Direct Download (Notarized) or TestFlight Public Link.

    *   Stress testing (Server load for analytics/feedback)
    *   Pricing validation (A/B test paywall placement)
    *   Marketing asset refinement (Screenshots, Copy)
*   **Action**: Launch "Forma vs. Chaos" social campaign.
*   **Success Metric**: 4.5/5 star average rating in feedback.

## 🚀 Phase 4: v1.0 Launch
