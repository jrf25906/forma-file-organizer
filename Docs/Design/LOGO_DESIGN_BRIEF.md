# Forma Logo Design Brief

## App Overview

**Forma** is a design-forward macOS file organization application that helps anyone get—and stay—organized using intelligent rules. The app features a sophisticated three-panel layout with frosted glass materials, floating action bars, and a keyboard-first workflow. While beautifully designed for users who appreciate great software, Forma is built for everyone.

**Core Values**: Design-forward, confident, sophisticated. Modern materials meet familiar concepts.

**Brand Personality**: Like Arc Browser meets native macOS - proudly visual, uses modern materials (frosted glass, depth, translucency) while remaining instantly recognizable as a file organization tool.

---

## Design Direction: Modern Materials + Folder Metaphor

The icon should combine:
1. **Familiar concept** - A folder or file organization metaphor (immediately communicates purpose)
2. **Modern materials** - Frosted glass, layered depth, translucency (echoes the app's visual language)

Think: A folder icon reimagined through the lens of macOS materials - glass-like surfaces, subtle gradients, layered depth.

---

## Design System Reference

### Color Palette
- **Bone White**: `#FAFAF8` (Light backgrounds)
- **Obsidian**: `#1A1A1A` (Primary dark)
- **Steel Blue**: `#5B7C99` (Primary interactive accent)
- **Sage**: `#7A9D7E` (Success states)
- **Muted Blue**: `#6B8CA8` (Documents category)
- **Warm Orange**: `#C97E66` (Media category)
- **Soft Green**: `#8BA688` (Downloads category)

### Visual Language
- **Materials**: Frosted glass, translucency, layered depth
- **Shapes**: Rounded corners (10px radius typical in app)
- **Depth**: Subtle shadows, borders for definition
- **Style**: Native macOS with design-forward confidence

### Design Principles
- Sophisticated yet approachable
- Material-forward (glass, depth, translucency)
- Instantly recognizable as file/folder related
- Works in monochrome for menu bar icon
- Scales well from 16x16px to 1024x1024px

## Primary Concept: Frosted Glass Folder

### Vision
A modern folder icon rendered with frosted glass materials - translucent surfaces, subtle depth, and the sophisticated aesthetic of macOS vibrancy effects.

### Detailed Prompt
```
Design a macOS app icon featuring a folder shape rendered with frosted glass/translucent
material effects. The folder should have:

- A translucent, frosted glass appearance (like macOS vibrancy)
- Subtle internal glow or luminosity suggesting depth
- Layered construction with visible depth (front tab, main body)
- Soft, diffused shadows creating lift from background
- Rounded corners consistent with macOS (12-16px radius)

Color approach:
- Primary folder surface: Frosted white/light gray with subtle blue tint (#E8EEF2)
- Folder tab/accent: Steel Blue (#5B7C99) with gradient
- Interior hint: Warm subtle glow suggesting organized contents
- Background: Soft gradient or solid that complements the glass effect

The icon should feel:
- Premium and sophisticated
- Instantly recognizable as a folder
- Modern (glass materials) yet timeless
- Like it belongs alongside Arc Browser, Craft, or Linear icons

Dimensions: 1024x1024px with proper macOS icon grid.
```

### Variations to Explore
- Folder with visible "files" inside shown through translucent surface
- Multiple layered folders with depth and transparency
- Folder with subtle category color accents (blue, orange, green strips)

---

## Alternative Concept: Layered Glass Panels

### Vision
Stacked translucent panels/cards representing organized file layers, with depth and material effects.

### Detailed Prompt
```
Design a macOS app icon featuring 3-4 layered rectangular panels stacked with slight
offset, each rendered as frosted glass:

- Each panel slightly translucent, showing layers beneath
- Panels stacked diagonally or with slight perspective
- Subtle shadows between layers creating depth
- Category colors visible as subtle tints on different layers:
  - Blue (#6B8CA8) - documents
  - Orange (#C97E66) - media
  - Green (#8BA688) - downloads

Material effects:
- Frosted glass appearance on each panel
- Soft inner glow/luminosity
- Refined edges with subtle borders
- Background gradient providing contrast

The composition should suggest organized structure while feeling modern and premium.
Dimensions: 1024x1024px.
```

---

## Alternative Concept: Glass Folder with Flow

### Vision
Frosted glass folder with subtle motion elements suggesting automatic organization.

### Detailed Prompt
```
Design a macOS app icon combining a frosted glass folder with subtle visual elements
suggesting file organization/flow:

- Main element: Translucent folder with glass material effect
- Secondary elements: 2-3 small abstract shapes (dots or short lines) in category
  colors appearing to flow into or organize within the folder
- The motion elements should be subtle and sophisticated, not cartoon-like

Colors:
- Folder: Frosted white/gray with Steel Blue (#5B7C99) accent
- Flow elements: Muted Blue (#6B8CA8), Warm Orange (#C97E66), Soft Green (#8BA688)

The overall feel should be calm and confident - organization happening smoothly
and automatically.
Dimensions: 1024x1024px.
```

## Technical Requirements

### File Deliverables
- Primary icon: 1024x1024px PNG (for App Store)
- Menu bar icon: 16x16px, 32x32px (monochrome template versions)
- Dock icon: 128x128px, 256x256px, 512x512px, 1024x1024px
- All formats: PNG with transparency
- Source file: Vector format (Figma, Sketch, AI, or PDF)

### Icon States
1. **Full color** (default dock/App Store icon)
2. **Template** (menu bar - adapts to light/dark mode automatically)
3. **Simplified** (16x16 menu bar - recognizable at small size)

### Platform Guidelines
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for macOS app icons
- Use macOS icon grid for proper proportions
- Test at small sizes (16x16, 32x32) for clarity
- Ensure icon works in both light and dark macOS appearance modes
- macOS automatically applies rounded corners to app icons (squircle mask)

---

## Icon Simplification for Small Sizes

For the 16x16px menu bar icon:
- **Primary**: Simple folder silhouette
- **Alternative**: Abstract "F" or stacked layers
- Must be recognizable at a glance
- Should work as a template image (single color that adapts to system)

---

## Mood & References

### Visual Inspiration
**Design-forward macOS apps:**
- Arc Browser - sophisticated materials, confident design
- Craft - beautiful glass effects, premium feel
- Linear - clean, modern, material-focused
- Things 3 - native macOS excellence

**macOS system aesthetic:**
- Finder folder - the familiar reference point
- Big Sur/Sonoma icon style - dimensional but not skeuomorphic
- Control Center / Widgets - frosted glass, vibrancy

### What to Capture
- Premium, sophisticated quality
- Modern materials (glass, depth, translucency)
- Familiar folder concept with fresh execution
- Confidence (this app is proud to be seen)

### Avoid
- Cartoon or playful illustrations
- Flat, generic corporate style
- Overly complex gradients or details
- Literal file/paper representations
- Skeuomorphic textures (leather, wood, paper grain)

---

## Design Questions to Consider

1. How much of the frosted glass effect can survive at small sizes?
2. Should the folder be open or closed?
3. How prominent should the category color accents be?
4. What background color/gradient works best behind the glass?
5. How does the icon look against both light and dark dock backgrounds?

---
