## Brand Strategy

### Brand Positioning

**"Give your files form."**

Forma isn't just another file organizer. It's a beautifully designed tool for anyone who wants to get organized. While the app is crafted with the attention to detail that design-conscious users will appreciate, it's built for everyone who values a clean, well-organized digital life. Forma brings order to chaos through intelligent, refined organization that feels native to macOS.

## Visual System

### Color Palette

Forma's color strategy is monochromatic with subtle, strategic accents.

---

#### **Primary Colors**

**Obsidian (Primary Dark):**
```
Hex: #1A1A1A
RGB: 26, 26, 26
HSL: 0° 0% 10%

Use for:
  - Primary text
  - Strong UI elements
  - Dark mode backgrounds
  - Icon fills
```

**Bone White (Primary Light):**
```
Hex: #FAFAF8
RGB: 250, 250, 248
HSL: 60° 33% 98%

Use for:
  - Light mode backgrounds
  - Text on dark surfaces
  - Subtle contrast
  - Breathing room
```

**Why Monochromatic:**

- Premium, refined aesthetic
- No visual noise

---

#### **Accent Colors**

**Steel Blue (Interactive):**
```
Hex: #5B7C99
RGB: 91, 124, 153
HSL: 208° 25% 48%

Use for:
  - Primary actions
  - Interactive elements
  - Links and buttons
  - Selected states
  - Progress indicators
```

**Sage (Success):**

```

**Accent Usage Rules:**
- Use sparingly (5-10% of interface)
- Only for interactive or status elements
- Never as backgrounds
- Always test contrast ratios

---

#### **Neutrals: System Colors**

**Always use macOS system colors for UI elements:**

```swift
// Backgrounds
Color(NSColor.windowBackgroundColor)      // Main background
Color(NSColor.controlBackgroundColor)     // Control backgrounds
Color(NSColor.textBackgroundColor)        // Text field backgrounds

// Text
Color(NSColor.labelColor)                 // Primary text
Color(NSColor.secondaryLabelColor)        // Secondary text
Color(NSColor.tertiaryLabelColor)         // Tertiary/metadata
Color(NSColor.quaternaryLabelColor)       // Placeholder text

// Separators
Color(NSColor.separatorColor)             // Borders, dividers
```

**Why System Colors:**
- Automatic dark mode support
- Accessibility (Dynamic Type, contrast)
- Native Mac feel
- Future-proof (updates with OS)

**Gray Scale (for mockups/design tools):**
```
Light Mode Text:
  Primary: #1C1C1E
  Secondary: #8E8E93
  Tertiary: #C7C7CC

Dark Mode Text:
  Primary: #FFFFFF
  Secondary: #98989D
  Tertiary: #48484A
```

---

#### **Semantic Colors: System Defaults**

For success, warning, error states - use system colors:

```swift
Success: Color.green      // #34C759 light, #30D158 dark
Warning: Color.orange     // #FF9500 light, #FF9F0A dark
Error: Color.red          // #FF3B30 light, #FF453A dark
Info: Color.blue          // #007AFF light, #0A84FF dark
```

**Usage:**
- Success: File successfully moved, rule matched
- Warning: No rule found, action needs attention
- Error: Move failed, permission denied
- Info: Helpful tips, onboarding guidance

---

#### **Color Usage Guidelines**

**Steel Blue Usage:**
- Primary action buttons (Organize, Accept, Save)
- Interactive elements requiring attention
- Progress indicators
- Selected/active states
- Hover states on clickable elements

**Sage Usage:**
- Success confirmations
- Completed actions
- Positive feedback states
- "All done" messages

**Obsidian/Bone White Usage:**
- All typography
- UI backgrounds
- Borders and separators
- Icons and glyphs
- Most of the interface (90-95%)

**Where NOT to use Accents:**
- Never as primary backgrounds
- Not for body text
- Not decoratively
- Not for borders (use neutrals)

**Contrast Requirements:**
- Steel Blue on Bone White: 4.5:1 minimum (AA compliant)
- Obsidian on Bone White: 16:1 (AAA compliant)
- Always test against actual backgrounds
- Support "Increase Contrast" accessibility setting

**Accessibility:**
- Never rely on color alone to convey information

---

### Typography

#### **Primary Typeface: SF Pro (System Font)**

**Why SF Pro:**
- Free and pre-installed on macOS
- Designed specifically for UI (legibility at all sizes)
- Automatic Dynamic Type support
- Optimized for Retina displays
- Two variants for different contexts

**Font Variants:**

```
SF Pro Display - For large sizes (>19pt)
  Use for: Headers, titles, welcome screens
  Slightly tighter tracking
  More elegant proportions

SF Pro Text - For UI and body (≤19pt)
  Use for: Body text, labels, buttons
  Optimized for smaller sizes
  Better readability

SF Pro Rounded - For friendly accents (optional)
  Use for: Onboarding, celebrations, friendly contexts
  Warmer, more approachable
  Use sparingly for personality
```

---

#### **Type Scale**

**Desktop/Window Sizes:**
```
Hero (Welcome screens):    32pt Bold
H1 (Screen titles):        24pt Semibold
H2 (Section headers):      20pt Semibold
H3 (Subsections):          17pt Semibold
Body Large:                15pt Regular
Body (Standard):           13pt Regular
Small (Metadata):          11pt Regular
Caption:                   10pt Regular
```

**Menu Bar Dropdown:**
```
Title:                     13pt Semibold
Menu Items:                13pt Regular
Metadata:                  11pt Regular
```

**Buttons:**
```
Primary Button:            13pt Semibold
Secondary Button:          13pt Regular
```

---

#### **Font Weights**

Use these weights consistently:

```
Regular (400):    Body text, descriptions, most UI
Medium (500):     Subtle emphasis, secondary buttons
Semibold (600):   Headers, buttons, labels, important text
Bold (700):       Hero text, primary emphasis (use sparingly)
```

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Light/Thin weights (poor readability)
- ❌ Heavy/Black weights (too aggressive)
- ❌ Mixing weights within same size/context

---

#### **Type Pairing (Phase 2)**

Once brand is established, consider adding a display font for marketing/personality:

**Recommended: Inter**
- Free, versatile, modern
- Excellent for headings and marketing
- Pairs perfectly with SF Pro
- Use for: Website, blog, promotional materials
- [Download: rsms.me/inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)

**Usage:**
- Inter: Headlines, marketing, personality
- SF Pro: All in-app UI, body text

---

#### **Monospace Typography**

For file paths, code-like elements:

**SF Mono (System monospace)**
```
Use for:
  - File paths (~Desktop/Documents/file.pdf)
  - Technical details
  - Rule syntax display
  - Developer-facing content

Weight: Regular or Medium only
Size: Same as body text (13pt typical)
Color: Secondary label color (gray)
```

**Example:**
```
Current: ~/Desktop/invoice.pdf
Destination: ~/Documents/Finance/Invoices/2024
```

---

#### **Typography Guidelines**

**Line Height:**
```
Tight (Headers):          1.2x font size
Normal (Body):            1.5x font size
Comfortable (Long text):  1.6-1.8x font size
```

**Paragraph Spacing:**
```
Between paragraphs: 1em (one line height)
Between sections: 2em (two line heights)
```

**Line Length:**
```
Optimal: 50-75 characters per line
Maximum: 90 characters per line
Short UI labels: No limit
```

**Alignment:**
```
Body text: Left-aligned (never justified)
Headers: Left-aligned
Centered: Only for welcome/empty states
Right-aligned: Never (RTL languages excepted)
```

**Letter Spacing:**
```
Do not adjust - SF Pro is pre-optimized
Exception: All-caps text can use +5% tracking
```

**Capitalization:**
```
Sentence case: All UI text, buttons, headers
Title Case: Only for proper names
ALL CAPS: Never (poor readability, accessibility)
```

---

### Spacing & Layout

#### **8pt Grid System**

All spacing should be multiples of 8px for visual rhythm:

```
4px:   Micro spacing (icon to text)
8px:   Tight spacing (related elements)
16px:  Standard spacing (most common)
24px:  Generous spacing (sections)
32px:  Large spacing (major sections)
48px:  Extra large (screen margins)
64px:  Huge spacing (empty states)
```

**Application:**
```
Padding inside buttons:     8px vertical, 16px horizontal
Padding inside cards:       16px all sides
Space between form fields:  16px
Space between sections:     32px
Screen edge margins:        24px minimum
```

---

#### **Layout Principles**

**Content Width:**
```
Single column (forms, text):    480-600px max
Multi-column (review interface): 800-1000px max
Full width (file lists):         No max, but use visual breaks
```

**Visual Hierarchy:**
```
1. Establish clear focal point (where eye lands first)
2. Group related elements with proximity
3. Use size contrast for importance
4. Add whitespace for breathing room
5. Guide eye movement with alignment
```

**Responsive Behavior:**
```
Minimum window width: 600px
Minimum window height: 400px
Preferred initial size: 800x600px
Maximum width: None (scales to screen)
```

---

### Icons & Illustrations

#### **Icon System: SF Symbols**

Use Apple's SF Symbols for all iconography:

**Why SF Symbols:**
- 5000+ icons, consistent style
- Automatic weight/size matching to text
- Multi-color and hierarchical options
- Localization support
- Updates with OS

**Usage:**
```swift
// Standard icon
Image(systemName: "folder")
    .foregroundColor(.secondary)

// With text (auto-aligns)
Label("Desktop", systemImage: "folder")

// Colored for state
Image(systemName: "checkmark.circle.fill")
    .foregroundColor(.green)
```

**Common Icons in App:**
```
Files/Folders:     folder, doc, photo, music.note
Actions:           arrow.right, checkmark, xmark, trash
Status:            checkmark.circle, exclamationmark.triangle
Navigation:        chevron.left, chevron.down, gear
```

**Icon Guidelines:**
- Always use filled variants for active states
- Use outline variants for inactive/secondary
- Match icon weight to surrounding text
- Pair with labels (don't use alone unless universal)
- Test at target size (some icons don't scale well)

---

#### **Illustrations (Phase 2)**

For empty states, onboarding, marketing:

**Style Direction:**
- Minimal, geometric
- Single color (purple) + grays
- Clean lines, no gradients
- No characters/people (abstract only)
- Scalable vector (SVG)

**Usage:**
- Empty states (no files found)
- Onboarding welcome screen
- Success celebrations
- Error states (sympathetic, not scary)

**Examples Concepts:**
- Organized grid vs. scattered items
- Files flowing into folders
- Abstract representations of order

---

### Motion & Animation

#### **Animation Principles**

**Purposeful, Not Decorative**
- Every animation should have a reason
- Explain state changes
- Guide attention
- Provide feedback
- Never animate for "wow" factor

**Fast, Not Slow**
- 200-300ms for most transitions
- 150ms for micro-interactions
- 400ms maximum for major changes
- Instant (<100ms) for critical actions

**Natural, Not Mechanical**
- Use ease-in-out curves
- Decelerate into final position
- Match physical intuition
- No bouncing/elastic (too playful)

---

#### **Standard Timings**

```
Micro-interaction:        150ms (hover, button press)
Standard transition:      250ms (navigation, state change)
Large transition:         400ms (modal appear, sheet slide)
Progressive disclosure:   200ms (expand/collapse)
```

**Easing Curves:**
```
Default: ease-in-out
Button press: ease-out (instant feedback)
Menu appear: ease-out (snappy)
Modal dismiss: ease-in (fade away)
```

**SwiftUI Implementation:**
```swift
// Standard animation
.animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.25), value: someState)

// Spring animation (use sparingly)
.animation(.spring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.8), value: someState)
```

---

#### **Specific Animations**

**Button Press:**
```
Duration: 150ms
Effect: Scale to 0.95, then back to 1.0
Easing: ease-out
```

**Navigation (Screen transition):**
```
Duration: 300ms
Effect: Slide + fade
Direction: Forward = right to left, Back = left to right
Easing: ease-in-out
```

**Progress Bar Fill:**
```
Duration: Smooth, continuous
Effect: Width increases
Easing: linear (represents real progress)
```

**Success State:**
```
Duration: 400ms
Effect: Checkmark scales in with subtle bounce
Then: Hold for 800ms, fade out over 200ms
Easing: ease-out
```

**Loading Spinner:**
```
Duration: Continuous rotation
Speed: 1 second per rotation
Easing: linear
```

---

#### **Animation Don'ts**

- ❌ No page transitions on every screen (only between major sections)
- ❌ No animations longer than 500ms
- ❌ No parallax effects
- ❌ No 3D flips or excessive transforms
- ❌ No elastic/bouncy animations (too casual)
- ❌ No looping animations unless loading
- ❌ No animating multiple properties at once (keep simple)

---

#### **Reduced Motion**

**Always respect system preference:**

```swift
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion

// Use reduced animations
if reduceMotion {
    withAnimation(nil) {
        // Instant state change
    }
} else {
    withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.25)) {
        // Smooth animation
    }
}
```

**Reduced Motion Alternatives:**
- Instant state changes (no animation)
- Fade only (no movement)
- Quick snap (100ms or less)
- Never remove functionality, just motion

---

## Voice & Tone

### Writing Principles

**1. Clear Over Clever**
- Say what you mean directly
- No puns, wordplay, or jokes
- Avoid marketing-speak
- Favor simple words

**Examples:**

- ❌ "Sorry! We failed to move your files 😢"

---

**3. Helpful, Not Judgmental**
- Never comment on messiness
- No guilt or shame

- ❌ "We don't know what to do with this file"

---

**4. Specific, Not Vague**
- Use exact numbers
- Name concrete actions
- Provide details when helpful
- Be precise about what will happen

**Examples:**
- ✅ "43 PDFs → Documents/Finance/Invoices"

### Punctuation & Grammar

**Contractions:**
- ✅ Use them: "We'll", "You're", "Can't"
- Natural and friendly
- Exception: Formal errors/warnings

**Exclamation Points:**
- Use sparingly (only for genuine success)
- Never multiple (no "!!!")
- Never in errors or instructions

**Ellipsis (...):**
- Only in loading states ("Scanning...")
- Never for dramatic pause
- Three dots, no more

**Oxford Comma:**
- Always use: "Files, folders, and downloads"

**Numbers:**
- Use numerals: "3 files", not "three files"
- Exception: "one" at start of sentence

**Time:**
- "a few seconds" not specific milliseconds
- "a moment" for short waits
- "this may take a minute" for longer

---

## Design Principles

Our design decisions flow from these core principles:

### 1. **Clarity Over Creativity**

**What it means:**
Users should never wonder what something does or what will happen when they click. Function is always more important than form.

**In practice:**
- Obvious button labels ("Organize Now" not "Go")
- Clear visual hierarchy (most important thing is most prominent)
- Predictable interactions (buttons look like buttons)
- No mystery meat navigation

**Example:**
✅ Button labeled "Move 43 Files to Documents/PDFs"  
❌ Button labeled "Organize" (what will it organize? where?)

---

### 2. **Invisible Until Needed**

**What it means:**
The best interface disappears. Show UI only when it provides value, then get out of the way.

**In practice:**
- Menu bar icon, not dock icon
- No unnecessary notifications
- Empty states that educate, don't decorate
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

**Example:**
✅ Menu bar icon shows badge when files need organizing  
❌ Desktop widget always visible taking up space

---

### 3. **Respect Intelligence**

**What it means:**
Users are smart. Don't over-explain, don't patronize, don't hide complexity out of fear.

**In practice:**
- Show reasoning when helpful ("Matched by Screenshots rule")
- Provide escape hatches (review before auto-organizing)
- Advanced features available but not required
- Trust users to make decisions

**Example:**
✅ "No rule found" with option to create one  
❌ "Oops! We're not sure what to do with this file. Don't worry, we won't touch it!"

---

### 4. **Speed is a Feature**

**What it means:**
Every millisecond matters. Fast software feels intelligent, responsive software builds trust.

**In practice:**
- <100ms for UI responses
- Background processing for heavy tasks
- Instant feedback on every action
- Progress indicators for >1 second tasks

**Example:**
✅ File list appears instantly, thumbnail loads progressively  
❌ Spinner blocks UI while loading everything

---

### 5. **Native First**

**What it means:**
Embrace macOS patterns. Don't reinvent what Apple already perfected.

**In practice:**
- Use system fonts, colors, controls
- Follow HIG (Human Interface Guidelines)
- Support system features (dark mode, reduced motion, etc.)
- Feel like a Mac app, not a web app

**Example:**
✅ Standard macOS buttons, menus, shortcuts  
❌ Custom-styled buttons that don't match any Mac app

---

### 6. **Opinionated Defaults, Flexible Options**

**What it means:**
Make smart decisions for users, but let them override anything.

**In practice:**
- Suggest rules based on file analysis
- Pre-fill forms with intelligent guesses
- Allow customization of everything
- Remember user's choices

**Example:**
✅ "We suggest organizing screenshots like this [edit]"  
❌ Empty form with no guidance

---

### 7. **Progressive Disclosure**

**What it means:**
Show complexity gradually. Start simple, reveal depth as needed.

**In practice:**
- Simple onboarding, advanced features discoverable
- Beginner mode vs. power user mode
- Tooltips and help available but not in your face
- Layers of information (overview → details)

**Example:**
✅ Basic rule builder, then "Advanced options" link  
❌ All options visible at once, overwhelming

---

### 8. **Error Prevention Over Error Handling**

**What it means:**
Design to prevent mistakes rather than recovering from them.

**In practice:**
- Preview before committing
- Confirm destructive actions
- Disable impossible actions
- Clear what each action does

**Example:**
✅ "This will move 28 files" preview screen  
❌ Move first, then show undo notification

---

  "Forma"
  
Body: Action-oriented

  "23 files ready to organize"
  
Action: Relevant next step

  "Review Now"
```

---

### First-Run Experience

**Goals:**
1. Set expectations (what the app does)
2. Get permissions (Full Disk Access)
3. Create first rule (show value immediately)
4. Organize files (prove it works)

**Flow:**
```
1. Welcome (value prop)
2. Permission request (with explanation)
3. Scan (discover files)
4. Rule setup (guided or automatic)
5. Review (show what will happen)
6. Organize (do the work)
7. Success (celebrate)
```

**Duration:**
- Fast path: ~45 seconds
- Careful path: 3-6 minutes

**Success metric:**
User completes first organization and understands how to use app again.

## Questions & Refinement

As you build and use the app, you'll discover what works and what doesn't. Revisit these questions periodically:

1. **Does the interface feel precise and refined?**
   - Is every detail considered?
   - Does it feel premium and well-crafted?

2. **Does it build trust over time?**
   - Do users rely on it more each week?
   - Are they comfortable with the suggestions?

3. **Does it become seamless?**
   - Do users stop thinking about it?
   - Is it truly elegant utility?

4. **Does the brand reflect reality?**
   - Do the colors feel sophisticated?
   - Does the personality match the product?
   - Does it appeal to anyone who wants to get organized?

---

**This is a living document.** Update it as you learn, grow, and refine the product.

The brand serves the product, not the other way around.
