## Description

**Your files. Your rules. Your approval.**

Forma is a beautifully designed file organizer that brings order to your digital workspace — without acting on its own. Nothing moves until you approve it. Everything can be undone.

**DESIGNED FOR CONTROL**
Your desktop deserves better than chaos. Forma sits as a layer on top of Finder, proposing changes and waiting for your approval. Preview every move before it happens. Undo any action with one click.

**PRECISE ORGANIZATION**
*   **Declarative Rules**: Create powerful organization logic with a few clicks. "Move all screenshots to a monthly folder," or "Archive old projects after 6 months."
*   **Pattern Matching**: Forma infers structure from filenames, dates, and apps — but never assumes. Every suggestion is inspectable.
*   **Ready-Made Templates**: Pre-loaded with 30+ rules for common file types — documents, screenshots, downloads, and more.

**REFINED EXPERIENCE**
*   **Native Design**: Built exclusively for macOS. Uses native file APIs. No Electron.
*   **Privacy First**: On-device processing. Files never leave your Mac.
*   **Full Reversibility**: Complete action history with one-click rollback.

**FEATURES**
*   **Preview Queue**: See every proposed change before execution
*   **Rule Builder**: Natural-language rule creation
*   **Undo Everything**: Experiment safely with full undo capabilities
*   **Background Monitoring**: (Coming Soon) Keep folders tidy automatically
