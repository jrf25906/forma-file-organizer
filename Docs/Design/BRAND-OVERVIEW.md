# Forma - Brand Overview

**Last Updated:** January 2025
**Status:** Design System Implemented, Visual Identity Finalized
**Strategic Foundation:** See [BRAND-POSITIONING.md](BRAND-POSITIONING.md) for messaging source of truth

---

## Quick Reference

**Brand Name:** Forma
**Tagline:** "Give your files form"
**Positioning:** A structural system layer for macOS files — not a replacement for Finder, but an executor of your intent
**Target Behavior:** People whose files outgrow folders — where screenshots, documents, assets, and ideas pile up faster than folders can handle

---

## The Core Reframe

**Forma is STRUCTURAL, not INTELLIGENT.**

Users don't ask: "Is this smart?"
They ask: "Where does this sit in my system?"

**Forma is:**
- A **system layer** on top of Finder, not a replacement
- An **executor of intent**, not an autonomous actor
- A **bounded tool**, not a magical one

**Winning Posture:**
> You give the orders. Forma executes them — and only after you approve.

---

## Trust Hierarchy (Messaging Order)

Lead with control. Follow with capability.

1. **You approve. It executes.** — Nothing moves without explicit approval
2. **Undo everything. Always.** — Full reversibility, complete action history
3. **Declarative rules.** — You define the logic in plain language
4. **Context awareness.** — Forma infers structure but never assumes

## Language Guidelines

### Avoid "Ghost of AI" Language

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Talk to it like a human" | "Declarative rules" or "Intent-based commands" |
| "AI-powered organization" | "Rule-based organization" |
| "Smart suggestions" | "Pattern-matched suggestions" |
| "Learns your preferences" | "Adapts to your corrections" |
| "Understands your files" | "Infers structure from patterns" |

### Replace Absolutes with Capabilities

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Never lose anything again" | "Full action history with one-click rollback" |
| "Zero files lost. Ever." | "Preview every change before it happens" |
| "Always organizes perfectly" | "Suggests destinations based on your rules" |

### Voice Principles
- **Clear, not clever** - Function over wordplay
- **Specific, not vague** - "Move to Documents" not "Organize"
- **Active voice** - Imperative mood ("Move file" not "File will be moved")
- **Sentence case** - No Title Case, No ALL CAPS
- **Confident tone** - No hedging ("will" not "should")
