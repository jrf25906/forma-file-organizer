# Forma Marketing Website Plan

## Design Direction (Finalized)

### Visual Style
- **Hero**: Abstract particle/shape flow - chaos → order animation
- **Beyond Hero**: Flat, minimal design with subtle scroll motion
- **Overall**: Dark obsidian aesthetic, bold confident typography

### Logo
- **Style**: Abstract geometric symbol
- **Concept**: Representing structure, organization, precision
- **Direction**: Simple, spatially suggestive (like Linear's stacked lines)

### Key Decisions
| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Structure | Single landing page |
| Beta access | TestFlight link |
| Screenshots | Capture later (design around placeholders) |
| Copy tone | Bold & confident |

### Features to Highlight
1. Smart Rules + Templates
2. Project Clustering
3. Review Before Organize
4. Activity Feed + Undo

## Animation Philosophy

- Natural ease-in-out curves
- No bouncy/elastic effects
- Respect reduced motion

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Hero animation**: Keep the current 3D cube, or evolve it?
2. **Scroll experience**: Parallax/animation-heavy, or more static?
3. **App visuals**: Do we have polished screenshots ready?
4. **Beta access**: Gated (email capture) or open download?
5. **Timeline**: When do you want to launch?

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Finalize page structure
2. [ ] Create content outline with copy
3. [ ] Design key sections in Figma (optional) or code directly
4. [ ] Build out sections incrementally
5. [ ] Add app screenshots/visuals
6. [ ] Polish animations and interactions
7. [ ] SEO and meta tags
8. [ ] Deploy to production
